# README

[ES2](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%9D%B1%E6%96%B9%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B2_%E5%A4%A9%E6%9C%9D%E5%B8%9D%E5%9C%8B) is a LPMud started by
[Annihilator](https://github.com/taedlar) since 1994. It is the first open source LPMud in Taiwan (and in the whole Chinese culture).
There are many Chinese MUD thereafter started base on its code base and developed their own contents.

## License
The original release of ES2 mudlib is licensed under a roughly written notice that forbids commercial-use and requires displaying the name
of "ES2 mudlib". Since 2022, it is released on github by Annihilator and placed under **MIT license**, so those old restrictions are no
longer required. Please note the initial commit in github repository is based on the ES2 mudlib v1.3b release. Annihilator also grant you
the choice to use any earlier released versions of ES2 mudlib under MIT license for less restrictions.

With the change of license, please note:

### Commercial Use

Yes, the ES2 mudlib under MIT licnese allows commercial-use.  

However, a LPMud mudlib requires a compatible LPMud driver to run on. Currently ES2 mudlib is known compatible with MudOS and
[Neolith](https://github.com/taedlar/neolith) (a MudOS fork, specially customized for ES2 mudlib), while both of them do not allow commercial-use.
It might be possible to run ES2 mudlib with popular [FluffOS](https://github.com/fluffos/fluffos) with some efforts.
And maybe future releases ES2 mudlib will eventually support certain LPMud drivers that allows commercial-use.

### Displaying "ES2 mudlib"

You are no longer required to display the name of ES2 mudlib if you start a mud with the ES2 mudlib. Annihilator still hold the copyright
of the name "ES2 mudlib". Since the original license requires (and grant user the rights) to display the name, changing to MIT license should
not affect how old users use the name. Annihilator grant you the PERMISSION TO DISPLAY "ES2 mudlib" in you MUD's login screen with the
disclaimer that ES2 mudlib is PROVIDED AS-IS and SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY DAMAGE possibly caused by the software to your assets or users.
